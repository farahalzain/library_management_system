# Library Management System

## Overview

The **Library Management System** is a simple Python project that simulates a small library.
It allows users to:

* View all available items
* Search items by title
* Borrow items
* Reserve items
* Return items

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python with classes like `Library`, `User`, and `Item`.
